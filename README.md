This is my personal static blog built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), mainly for notes, rambling, experiments, and occasional rants. Here I turned it into a template and feel free to use.

## Tech Stack

To deploy your blog to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Update `astro.config.mjs` with your GitHub username and repository name:
   ```js
   export default defineConfig({
     site: 'https://your-username.github.io',
     base: '/your-repo-name',
     // ... other config
   });
   ```

2. Build your project:

   ```

Make sure to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with your repository name.

### Deploy using Vercel
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/Syomes/syome-blog/)

Click the button above to deploy this project to **Vercel**. After deployment, make sure to configure the following environment variables in **Settings > Environment Variables**

Then add these items:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your github token
- `PUBLIC_GITHUB_USERNAME`: Your github username

## Features

### Custom Contents
This blog template includes a custom section for adding custom contents to the blog. You can add your own information, contents, etc. in the `src/custom/` directory.

### Markdown Rendering

The blog uses a custom Markdown rendering system with the following features:

1. **Tailwind CSS Typography Plugin** - Provides beautiful default styles for all Markdown elements
2. **Enhanced Markdown Renderer Component** - Custom Astro component with additional styling options
3. **Custom Processor** - Built with the remark/rehype ecosystem for maximum control

### GitHub Stats

This blog includes a GitHub stats feature that displays various statistics about your GitHub activity. The stats are fetched via GitHub API and include:

1. **Contributions** - Total contribution count across all years
2. **Repositories** - Breakdown of your repositories:
   - Repositories you own
   - Repositories you collaborate on
3. **Stars** - Total stars across all your non-fork repositories
4. **Pull Requests** - Total pull requests you've created
5. **Issues** - Total issues you've created
6. **Languages** - Breakdown of programming languages used in your repositories

**Statistics can now be switched to different categories: `Personal`, `Collaborator` and their `public`, `private` ones!**

---

The GitHub stats are fetched from the client side by making a request to `/api/github-stats`, which is an Astro API route that communicates with GitHub's GraphQL and REST APIs.

Note that the repository counts only include `non-fork repositories` you own or collaborate on. The current implementation does not include repositories you've contributed to but don't own or collaborate on, which provides a more focused view of your direct work rather than all contributions.

## Post Guidelines

### Markdown Content

All blog posts and repos are written in Markdown and stored in `src/content/`. Each post should include frontmatter with:

- `title` - The post title
- `description` - A short description of the post
- `pubDate` - Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `tags` - Optional array of tags
- `pin` - Optional boolean to pin the post or repo on `Recommended Reading` (only ONE for posts or repos)
- `language` - Reops' language usage for its post
- `repoUrl` - The github URL of the repo

> [!TIP]
> 1. While typing fenced code block, keep the first line of the code block empty can `hide the copy button`
> 2. About `![]()` syntax for images injection, fill the alt text in `[]` will automatically generate a `<figcaption>` under the image.

### Styling

Styling is done with Tailwind CSS. Custom styles should be added to component files or global styles in `src/styles/`.

### Components

Reusable components are located in `src/components/`. Each component should be self-contained and well-documented.
